You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\n\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\n    Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature\u0027s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can\u0027t use them.\n\n    When you transform, you assume the beast\u0027s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed.

However, you can\u0027t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\n\n    You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature\u0027s shape and size.
