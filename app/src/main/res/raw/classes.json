Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long. The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away. A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like. The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early. You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object).

You can create additional experimental elixirs by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the elixirâ€™s effect from the Experimental Elixir table. Creating an experimental elixir requires you to have alchemistâ€™s supplies on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest. When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each elixirâ€™s effect separately. Each elixir requires its own flask. 1, Healing. The drinker regains a number of hit points equal to 2d4 + your Intelligence modifier. 2, Swiftness. The drinkerâ€™s walking speed increases by 10 feet for 1 hour. 3, Resilience. The drinker gains a +1 bonus to AC for 10 minutes. 4, Boldness. The drinker can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to every attack roll and saving throw they make for the next minute. 5, Flight. The drinker gains a flying speed of 10 feet for 10 minutes. 6, Transformation. The drinkerâ€™s body is transformed as if by the alter self spell. The drinker determines the transformation caused by the spell, the effects of which last for 10 minutes."
