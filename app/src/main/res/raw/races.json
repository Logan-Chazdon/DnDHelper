An eladrin is associated with one of the four seasons and has coloration reminiscent of that season, which can also affect the eladrin's mood:\n\n    Autumn is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer's harvest is shared with all.\n    Winter is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers.\n    Spring is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter's sorrow passes.\n    Summer is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy.\n\nSome eladrin remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other eladrin transform, adopting characteristics of a new season.\n\nWhen finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin's current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.",

When you use your Fey Step, one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before you teleport must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.\n    Spring. When you use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5 feet of you. That creature then teleports instead of you, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you.\n    Summer. Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage).",
