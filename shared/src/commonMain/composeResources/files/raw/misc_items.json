They are primarily refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise. Dragonshard dust is used in the creation of magic items, and many powerful tools — such as the lightning rail and elemental airships — require an ongoing expenditure of Eberron dragonshards to maintain their enchantments."
